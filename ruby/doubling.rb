# Create an array of 10 numbers.
# Write a separate "doubling" function that returns any number it is given multiplied by two.
# Iterate through the array, passing each number to the "doubling" function in turn.
# Save the original numbers and the doubled results as key-value pairs in a hash object.
#
# Write your solution here.
